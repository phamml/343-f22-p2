  <h1>CS 343 Project 2 - Report</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Link to deployed version of app: https://phamml.github.io/343-f22-p2/</li>
    <li>App functionality: Film Finding is a basic movie searching app that allows users to input a keyword
        or a specific movie title and then generates results based on the input provided. The results generate
        a list of movies that match the provided input displaying the movie title, movie poster img, release date,
        user rating, list of providers that movie is available on, and a brief overview of the movie. Once results
        are displayed, users will be allowed to filter results by release date as well as sort alphabetically by 
        movie title. Displays max 40 results due to time complexity issues and to make sure app is efficient. Also, there are a limited number of calls to API.
        Would love to improve on this with more time to allow app to show all reults.
